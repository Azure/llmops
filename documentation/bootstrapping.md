# Bootstrapping a New Project

In this section, you will learn how to start a new project using a project template. The bootstrapping process will create a new project repository on GitHub and populate it with content from the project template. Additionally, it will set up the development environment for your project, ensuring that you have everything you need to get started quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites

* [Azure CLI (az)](https://aka.ms/install-az) - to manage Azure resources.
* [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd) - to manage Azure deployments.
* [GitHub CLI (gh)](https://cli.github.com/) - to create GitHub repo.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - to update repository contents.

You will also need:
* [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) - sign up for a free account.
* [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup) - sign up for a free account.
* [Access to Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access) - submit a form to request access.
* Permissions to create a Service Principal (SP) in your Azure AD Tenant.
* Permissions to assign the Owner role to the SP within the subscription.

## Steps to Bootstrap a Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Clone the LLMOps Repo (this repository)**

   Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/azure/llmops
=======
1. **Clone the LLMOps Repo (this repository) into a temporary directory**

   Clone the repository from GitHub into a temporary directory:

   ```sh
    mkdir temp
    cd temp
    git clone https://github.com/azure/llmops
>>>>>>> origin/main
   ```

2. **Define Properties for Bootstrapping**

<<<<<<< HEAD
   Enter the `llmops` directory, rename the `bootstrap.properties.template` file to `bootstrap.properties`, and update it with the following information:
=======
    Go to the `llmops` directory.

   ```sh
    cd llmops
   ```

   Create a copy of the `bootstrap.properties.template` file with this filename `bootstrap.properties`.

    ```sh
    cp bootstrap.properties.template bootstrap.properties
    ```

    Open the `bootstrap.properties` with a text editor and update it with the following information:
>>>>>>> origin/main

   - **GitHub Repo Creation** (related to the new repository to be created)
     - `github_username`: Your GitHub **username**.
     - `github_use_ssh`: Set to **true** to interact with GitHub repos using [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-ssh-urls), **false** to use [HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls).
     - `github_template_repo`: The project template repository. Ex: *azure/llmops-project-template*.
     - `github_new_repo`: The bootstrapped project repo to be created. Ex *placerda/my-rag-project*.
     - `github_new_repo_visibility`: Visibility of the new repository, choose **public**, **private** or **internal**.

<<<<<<< HEAD
        > For private or internal repositories, you must use GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise. 
=======
        > For private or internal repositories, you must use GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise.
>>>>>>> origin/main

   - **Dev Environment Provision Properties**
     - `azd_dev_env_provision`: Set to **true** to provision a development environment.
     
          > If you set it to **false**, you will need to manually create the environment for the project.

     - `azd_dev_env_name`: The name of the development environment. Ex: *rag-project-dev*.
     - `azd_dev_env_subscription`: Your Azure subscription ID.
<<<<<<< HEAD
     - `azd_dev_env_location`: The Azure region for your dev environment. Ex: *eastus*.

    > The dev environment resources will be created in the selected subscription and region. This decision should consider the quota available for the resources to be created in the region, as well as the fact that some resources have specific features enabled only in certain regions. Therefore, ensure that the resources to be created by the IaaC of your template project have quota and availability in the chosen subscription and region. More information about the resources to be created can be found on the template page, as shown in this example: [LLMOps Project Template Resources](https://github.com/Azure/llmops-project-template/blob/main/README.md#project-resources).
=======
     - `azd_dev_env_location`: The Azure region for your dev environment. Ex: *eastus2*.

>>>>>>> origin/main

   Here is an example of the `bootstrap.properties` file:

   ```properties
   github_username="placerda"
   github_use_ssh="true"
   github_template_repo="azure/llmops-project-template"
   github_new_repo="placerda/my-rag-project"
   github_new_repo_visibility="public"
   azd_dev_env_provision="true"
   azd_dev_env_name="rag-project-dev"
   azd_dev_env_subscription="12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789098"
<<<<<<< HEAD
   azd_dev_env_location="eastus"
=======
   azd_dev_env_location="eastus2"
>>>>>>> origin/main
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Azure and GitHub**

   Log in to Azure CLI:

   ```sh
   az login
   ```

   Log in to Azure Developer CLI:

   ```sh
   azd auth login
   ```

   Log in to GitHub CLI:

   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

4. **Run the Bootstrap Script**

   The bootstrap script is available in two versions: Bash (`bootstrap.sh`) and PowerShell (`bootstrap.ps1`). 

   Run the appropriate script for your environment.

   **For Bash:**

   ```sh
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```

   **For PowerShell:**

   ```powershell
   .\bootstrap.ps1
   ```

    At the end of its execution, the script will have created and initialized the new repository and provisioned the development environment resources, provided you set `azd_dev_env_provision` to true. During its execution, the script checks if the new repository exists and creates it if it does not. It then clones the template repository and mirrors it to the new repository. Additionally, it sets the default branch for the new repository.

5. **Create a Service Principal**

   Create a service principal using the following command:

   ```sh
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<your-service-principal-name>" --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/<your-subscription-id> --sdk-auth
   ```

   > Ensure that the output information created here is properly saved for future use.

6. **Set GitHub Environment Variables**

   Go to the newly created project repository and set the following GitHub environment variables and secret for three environments: `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`.

   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `AZURE_ENV_NAME`
     - `AZURE_LOCATION`
     - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
   
   - **Secret:**
     - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`

   After creating the variables and secret, your Environments page should resemble the following example:
   
   ![Environments Page](../media/bootstrapping_environments.png)
   
   Below is an example of environment variable values for a development environment:
   
   ![Environment Variables](../media/bootstrapping_env_vars.png)
   
   The `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret should be formatted as follows:
    
   ```json
   {
       "clientId": "your-client-id",
       "clientSecret": "your-client-secret",
       "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
       "tenantId": "your-tenant-id"
   }
   ```

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   > **Note:** If you are only interested in experimenting with this accelerator, you can use the same subscription, varying only `AZURE_ENV_NAME` for each enviornment.

7. **Enable GitHub Actions**

   Ensure that GitHub Actions are enabled in your repository, as in some cases, organizational policies may not have this feature enabled by default. To do this, simply click the button indicated in the figure below:

   ![Enable Actions](../media/enable_github_actions.png)

>>>>>>> origin/main
That's all! Your new project is now bootstrapped and ready to go.
