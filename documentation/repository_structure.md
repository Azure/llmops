# Repository Structure

This accelerator utilizes project templates as its foundation. Therefore, we've structured our repository system to include a primary repository, which contains comprehensive documentation and step-by-step instructions for initiating projects using these templates. To maintain simplicity and promote cohesion within each repository, we allocate a separate repository for each project template. The diagram below illustrates the proposed structure.
